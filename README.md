### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Vitjs](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

This project involved building a simple web application that fetches random advice using Axios and displays it on the screen. The application was built using Typescript and TailwindCSS, which allowed for the use of modern syntax and responsive styling.

While building the project, I learned how to use Axios to fetch data from an external API and how to work with Typescript syntax. Additionally, I gained a better understanding of positioning elements on the screen and adding shadows on hover using TailwindCSS.
